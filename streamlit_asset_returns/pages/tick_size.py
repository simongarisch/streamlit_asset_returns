        Minimum price steps are discrete and

        Many models of returns assume that they are drawn from a continuous distribution,
        but price steps mean that only specific return values are possible for a given price.
        Here we use Cooper Energy (COE.AX) as an example as the minimum tick size of 1/2 cent
        is meaningful for a stock price of $0.385 (at the time of writing).

        $0.005/0.385 = 1.3\%$

        Given the current price, returns between 0 - 1.3% are not possible.
